        As a Technology Analyst with over 3+ years of expertise in React,
        TypeScript, and JavaScript, my focus lies in developing responsive user
        interfaces and enhancing application performance. I have a proven track
        record of working collaboratively with cross-functional teams to deliver
        high-quality software solutions and improve user experience.
      </p>
      <p className="text-xl pb-5">
        I am a software developer with 3 years of professional experience
        specializing in ReactJs and TypeScript. I have leveraged these
        technologies to build and optimize interactive, user-friendly
        applications, and have a good understanding of web development
        fundamentals.
      </p>
      <p className="text-xl pb-5">
        In addition to my professional experience, I have hands-on experience
        with Java and Spring Boot through personal projects. This experience has
        given me a strong foundation in back-end development and has allowed me
        to build full-stack applications.
      </p>
      <p className="text-xl">
        To further enhance my data structures and algorithms knowledge, I have
        solved approximately 90 problems on LeetCode. This practice has not only
        improved my problem-solving skills but also deepened my understanding of
        algorithmic efficiency and complexity analysis. I am always eager to
        learn and improve, and I believe that my blend of experiences and
        eagerness to grow make me a strong software developer.
